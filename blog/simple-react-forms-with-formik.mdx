## Introduction

I wanted to share how I use [Formik](https://formik.org) to write forms in my react code. I expect you've already heard and tried `Formik` before so we can discuss mostly component structure here. This article is not intended to be a full `Formik` tutorial. [Formik docs](https://formik.org/docs/overview) has all the information you need.

## useFormik hook

Out of different ways you can use `Formik` to create forms, the `useFormik` hook is the only thing I've ever needed. It takes a `config` object and returns an object with all the tools we need to create forms.

The minimum values you need to add in the `config` object are:

1. `initialValues` object - Values that go inside the form fields when the form is rendered. This is the initial state of the form.

2. `onSubmit` function - Receives the final values when the user submits the form. Use this function to clean up the `values` if needed before sending it to the server.

3. `validate` function - Run validations on values and return errors. There is an alternative `validationSchema` which you can use to define a schema using [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) object schema validation library.

```jsx
const formik = useFormik({
  initialValues,
  onSubmit,
  validate,
});

const {
  values,
  errors,
  handleSubmit,
  setFieldValue,
  ...andManyOthers
} = formik;
```

## Component Structure

I always use the good old two-level `container & presentational` structure for forms.

1. A container component where I define all the `config` that goes in `useFormik(config)` hook.
2. A presentational component that receives this `config` prop and renders the form component.

This structure is a general style to write reusable components. This works even better for forms by creating separate containers for `create` and `edit` items but uses the same `<Form />` component that displays the form.

For example, a user account form structure looks like this.

1. `<CreateUserFormContainer />`
2. `<UpdateUserFormContainer />`
3. `<UserForm />`

`validate` function or `validationSchema` goes in another file and imported into form containers.

Even if you don't need both `create` and `edit`, writing a form container keeps things clear in large forms.

If we are using both forms, I also send an extra `isNew` prop to `<UserForm />` to know whether it's a `create` form or an `edit` form. This helps to display correct error messages and other text.

## Final Thoughts

Although we've only needed the `useFormik` hook, if you want to create custom fields using Formik elements like `<Field>`, `<ErrorMessage>`, `useFormik` won't work. So, be sure to check [useFormik docs](https://formik.org/docs/api/useFormik) to see what are you missing by using the `useFormik` hook.

If you find yourself writing too many conditionals in JSX to use the same `<Form />` for both `create` and `edit` or there are a lot of differences in form fields in `create` and `edit` forms, it's time to separate them in different components.

You never need to store form data in a global state especially using state-management libraries like Redux or MobX.
