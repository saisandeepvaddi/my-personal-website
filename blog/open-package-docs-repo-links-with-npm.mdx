title: Open package docs and git repository links with npm

When we need to quickly see the documentation for an npm package, we generally either go to the package website or use a search engine right?

There is a quicker way to directly go to the package docs or git repository right from `npm` CLI.

## To open the package documentation

```shell
  npm docs [package-name]
```

This essentially opens the `Homepage` link you see on the npm website. `npm docs react` will open [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org).

## To open the package Git repository

```shell
  npm repo [package-name]
```

This opens the `Repository` link you see on the npm website. `npm repo react` will open [https://github.com/facebook/react](https://github.com/facebook/react).

## What about Yarn?

I'm not aware of an exactly similar feature in Yarn. But `yarn info <package> [<field>]` comes close. It will display the information about the `package` right in your terminal instead of opening links.

`yarn info next` will display the information about `next` package. You can also see specific information about a field like `yarn info next description` or `yarn info next readme`.

Although, I found it inconsistent. For me `yarn info react readme` shows `undefined`. Check the [yarn info docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/info) for more.
